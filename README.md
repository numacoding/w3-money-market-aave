# Decentralized Bank (AAVE)
This repository contains the code and the corresponding testing for the creation of a Smart Contract that works as a decentralized bank, allowing you to deposit and withdraw $DAI, as well as request loans in $USDC.
This repository contains part of the code used for the second part of my medium post "[From Banking Theory to Blockchain Reality: Creating a Decentralized Bank with Solidity (part 1)](https://medium.com/@numacodes/extrapolating-concepts-to-web3-coding-and-understanding-a-decentralized-bank-using-solidity-69797a771c47)" in which I explain how Traditional Banks work, and how they are different from Decentralized Banks.

## Roadmap
- [x] Write Smart Contract
- [x] Deployment Scripts
- [ ] Function and code testing
- [ ] Mainnet/Testnet testing
- [ ] Polish Markdown 

## Tests:
- Should deposit DAI
- Should withdraw DAI
- User should be able to receive USDC
- User should be able to repay USDC
